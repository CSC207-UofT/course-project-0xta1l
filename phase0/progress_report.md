Scenario Walk-through


Skeleton Program


Open questions our group is struggling with:

1. Currently, we have a recipe dataset and a user dataset that stores all the recipes and usersHow do we store data about recipes and users? How do we add new recipes and new users to the GenreLibrary and UserSecurity datasets?

HOW TO STORE DATA
Two “entities” are actually constants that keep track of every entity that has been created
How does clean architecture work with database on the outside, if having a base of users is integral to the program??

Does having Recipe as an entity (and also User) mean that we would have 500 classes? -> TUESDAY MEETING TOO
RecipeSave seems tiny??
Use exceptions to verify input data rather than ambiguous boolean
How do we store recipes? Database? Each recipe is a subclass?
Add getReviews for a recipe (displays all reviews made about this recipe)
Add getReviews for a user (displays all reviews a user has made, about different recipes)



What has worked well so far with our design:

### 1. How our program features adhere to the principles of universal design ###

**Principle 1: Equitable Use**

Our program is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities because of how simple and intuitive the overall design is.  Every person is able to use the app in the same way and there is no segregation or stigma in any form. Regarding privacy, our program ensures that no two users have the same username, so when a new user creates an account they cannot choose an existing username; and, we use regular expressions to test for password strength. These security mechanisms are equally available to all users.  The design is also appealing to all users because the app’s buttons are large and straightforward, the font is readable, the colors have strong contrast between features, and there are images in each recipe for clarity.

**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**

Our program accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities because we focused on user-oriented design. The app is accessible to people who are either right- or left-handed as we aimed for our buttons/text inputs to be mostly centred in the screen. We also facilitate the user’s accuracy and precision by allowing users to edit their text inputs such as name, age, bio, interests, etc, in case they made a mistake on the first try. The user is able to navigate the app at their own pace as well and move back and forth between pages anytime.

**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**

The program’s design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level because of how straightforward we made our app. Although the app is in English, we aim to use simple English words and intuitive design in conveying a feature to the user. We also create space for non-English speakers to do trial and error with various features. For example, in the sorting feature, users can select Sort By Interest and see immediately that the list of recipes are sorted with their preferences at the top. If that type of sorting wasn’t what they wanted, they can select for other options and try again. We do aim to incorporate more languages in our app for the future. We also arrange information consistent with its importance; for example, in a recipe a user can see in the left-to-centre space the recipe ingredients, instructions, and other details and in the right space they can easily see the buttons for saving the recipe and viewing its reviews. This structure of information allows for simple and efficient use. We also provide for effective feedback after a user completes a task; for example, when a user edits their profile information, they are able to see an instant change on their profile.

**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**

Our app design aims to communicate necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions. We include a picture in each recipe to avoid redundant presentation of essential information, high contrast such as between recipe titles/images and the background as well as between recipe information and the save/reviews buttons, and maximal legibility for headings and buttons. We hope to implement a text-to-speech feature in the future to communicate to users with sensory limitations.

**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**

This principle does not apply to our program because there is no way for any hazards or adverse consequences of accidental actions to occur at anytime a user is using our program. The program does not request the user to move their body during the app other than for the clicking/pressing of buttons and the typing of certain information. With regards to trivial error that a user has made such as inputting the wrong age, they can easily edit their information in their profile page.

**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**

Our program can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue. We do not enforce any strenuous activity during our app, so the user can maintain a neutral body position. The only actions that a user needs to make physically is to click/press buttons and type information. To minimize repetitive actions, there is a navigation bar located at the bottom of the app’s screen. This bar contains all the main pages a user can go to such as the recommended recipes page, the search recipes page, the upload recipes page, the user’s saved recipes page, and the user profile page so that the user does not have to click the back arrow all the time.

**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**

The app provides appropriate size and space for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility.  For any seated or standing user, the important elements on a page are always located at the centre and in the case of a full recipe view the important buttons such as the save/reviews buttons are boldly positioned for convenient touch. The buttons are large enough to accommodate any hand/finger size.

### 2. Target Audience ###
Our program is an interactive culinary application that allows users to discover recipes around the globe, build their own portfolio of recipes, and share their creative recipes with others. We market our app towards anyone who enjoys cooking and being part of a culinary community! We hope to reach those who are curious about trying unfamiliar flavours as well as in need of a platform to organize their favourite recipes and share homemade ones.

### 3. Certain demographics less likely to use our program ###
Our program is accessible by most demographics, but there may be certain demographics who could have trouble accessing it. Specifically, our program is currently designed in English and people who aren’t familiar with the English language may find it difficult to navigate the app.  Also, we don’t have a text to speech feature implemented, so people who are visually impaired are not able to access the app without external support.

**SPECIFICATION**

Our project domain is a recipe organizer program that allows users to discover new recipes, build their own collection of recipes, and interact with the recipes.

Each recipe is composed of a recipe title, a brief description, ingredients, instructions, and an estimated preptime. Recipes are sorted into various ‘genres’ (categories). Some example genres: Jamaican food, Mexican food, Vegetarian, Dessert, Breakfast, Summer, Fruit). A recipe must belong to at least one genre, and can (and often will!) belong to more than a single genre. Additionally, there is a genre called “all” that contains every single recipe stored in the program.

Users can create personal accounts that consist of a unique login (unique username and password) and display information (display picture and display name). After making an account, users can interact with recipes in various ways. They can create a personal collection of recipes by saving them (similar to how you can save songs on Spotify or save posts on Instagram/Facebook). Users can also review recipes by rating the recipe out of 5 stars and leaving an optional comment. Finally, users can upload their own recipes for other users to view and interact with.

For extended functionality from phase 0, we have implemented a recommendation system where upon login users will be notified of new recipes to try out. These recommended recipes are automatic and based on user-to-recipe interactions. For example, if a user has been saving a lot of Japanese recipes into their recipe collection, they are more likely to receive Japanese recipes in their recommendations! We have also implemented a feature that allows users to filter recipes by inputting a genre keyword as well as sort recipes alphabetically, by interest, or by rating (highest to lowest).
